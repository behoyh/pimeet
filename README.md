This project shows how a Raspberry Pi 4 can turn any room into a cheap, portable conference room with a touchless experience that can be used for hybrid meetings.

## TL;DR
This project configures a RP4 to autologin, start Chromium as a dedicated Google account and automatically join the first meeting on its calendar. This current is currently successfully rolled out in ~10 rooms at a small non-profit in Kirkland, WA, and has turned those rooms into meeting rooms.

Further information will be included soon, as the previous information on this page was severely out-of-date.
